    "### Insertion and Deletion of Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Python, you can insert elements into a list using .insert() or .append(). For removing elements from a list, you can use their counterparts: .remove() and .pop().\n",
    "\n",
    "    The main difference between these methods is that you use .insert() and .remove() to insert or remove elements at a specific position in a list, but you use .append() and .pop() only to insert or remove elements at the end of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now, something you need to know about Python lists is that inserting or removing elements that are not at the end of the list requires some element shifting in the background, making the operation more complex in terms of time spent. You can read the article mentioned above on how lists are implemented in Python to better understand how the implementation of .insert(), .remove(), .append() and .pop() affects their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    With all this in mind, even though inserting elements at the end of a list using .append() or .insert() will have constant time, O(1), when you try inserting an element closer to or at the beginning of the list, the average time complexity will grow along with the size of the list: O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Linked lists, on the other hand, are much more straightforward when it comes to insertion and deletion of elements at the beginning or end of a list, where their time complexity is always constant: O(1).\n",
    "\n",
    "    For this reason, linked lists have a performance advantage over normal lists when implementing a queue (FIFO), in which elements are continuously inserted and removed at the beginning of the list. But they perform similarly to a list when implementing a stack (LIFO), in which elements are inserted and removed at the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieval of Elements\n",
    "    When it comes to element lookup, lists perform much better than linked lists. When you know which element you want to access, lists can perform this operation in O(1) time. Trying to do the same with a linked list would take O(n) because you need to traverse the whole list to find the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When searching for a specific element, however, both lists and linked lists perform very similarly, with a time complexity of O(n). In both cases, you need to iterate through the entire list to find the element you’re looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## collections.deque (How to use it)\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Python, there’s a specific object in the collections module that you can use for linked lists called deque (pronounced “deck”), which stands for double-ended queue.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    collections.deque uses an implementation of a linked list in which you can access, insert, or remove elements from the beginning or end of a list with constant O(1) performance.\n"

    "    With queues, you want to add values to a list (enqueue), and when the timing is right, you want to remove the element that has been on the list the longest (dequeue). For example, imagine a queue at a trendy and fully booked restaurant. If you were trying to implement a fair system for seating guests, then you’d start by creating a queue and adding people as they arrive:\n",

    "\n",
    "    What if you wanted to create a stack instead? Well, the idea is more or less the same as with the queue. The only difference is that the stack uses the LIFO approach, meaning that the last element to be inserted in the stack should be the first to be removed.\n",

    "    There are a few things to keep in mind while implementing the above. First, as with add_after(), you want to make sure to raise an exception if the linked list is empty (line 2) or the node you’re looking for is not present (line 16).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Second, if you’re trying to add a new node before the head of the list (line 5), then you can reuse add_first() because the node you’re inserting will be the new head of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, for any other case (line 9), you should keep track of the last-checked node using the prev_node variable. Then, when you find the target node, you can use that prev_node variable to rewire the next values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once again, an example is worth a thousand words:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "llist = LinkedList()\n",
    "llist.add_before(\"a\", Node(\"a\"))\n",

    "```python\n",
    "llist = LinkedList([\"b\", \"c\"])\n",
    "llist\n",
    "```\n",
    "<code>>>> b -> c -> None</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "llist.add_before(\"b\", Node(\"a\"))\n",
    "llist\n",

    "## How to Remove a Node\n",
    "\n",
    "    To remove a node from a linked list, you first need to traverse the list until you find the node you want to remove.\n",
    "    Once you find the target, you want to link its previous and next nodes. This re-linking is what removes the target node\n",
    "    from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    That means you need to keep track of hte previous mnode as you traverse the list. Have a look at an implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def remove_node(self, target_node_data):\n",
    "    if self.head is None:\n",
    "        raise Exception(\"List is empty\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    if self.head.data == target_node_data:\n",
    "        self.head = self.head.next\n",
    "        return\n",
    "\n",
    "    previous_node = self.head\n",
    "    for node in self:\n",
    "        if node.data == target_node_data:\n",
    "            previous_node.next = node.next\n",
    "            return\n",
    "        previous_node = node\n",
    "\n",
    "    raise Exception(\"Node with data '%s' not found\" % target_node_data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the above code, you first check that your list is not empty (line 2). If it is, then you raise an exception. After that, you check if the node to be removed is the current head of the list (line 5). If it is, then you want the next node in the list to become the new head.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If none of the above happens, then you start traversing the list looking for the node to be removed (line 10). If you find it, then you need to update its previous node to point to its next node, automatically removing the found node from the list. Finally, if you traverse the whole list without finding the node to be removed (line 16), then you raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notice how in the above code you use previous_node to keep track of the, well, previous node. Doing so ensures that the whole process will be much more straightforward when you find the right node to be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here’s an example using a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "llist = LinkedList()\n",
    "llist.remove_node(\"a\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "<code>>>> Exception: List is empty</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "llist = LinkedList([\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\"])\n",
    "llist\n",
    "```\n",
    "<code>>>> a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> None</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "llist.remove_node(\"a\")\n",
    "llist\n",
    "```\n",
