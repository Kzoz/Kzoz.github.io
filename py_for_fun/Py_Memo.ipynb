We don’t measure the speed of an algorithm in seconds (or minutes!). Instead, we measure the number of operations it takes to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The O is short for “Order of”. So, if we’re discussing an algorithm with O(n), we say its order of, or rate of growth, is n, or linear complexity.\n",
