RS-232C interface has the following two modes.
 Stream mode Outputs data continuously and can be used to print data.
 Command mode Controls the scale using commands from a computer.

To use RS-232C interface, set the parameters of the “Baud rate ( f4 )”, “ Output
mode ( f5 )”, “ Format ( f15 )” in the function table.
 
Optional cables are available as follows:
 AX-KO577A-200 RS-232C cable, D-sub 25 pin, 2 m
 AX-KO1786-200 RS-232C cable, D-sub 9 pin, 2 m

 Transmission system:	 EIA RS-232C
 Transmission:		 Asynchronous, bi-directional, half-duplex
 Data format:		 Baud rate 2400, 4800, 9600 bps
 			 Data 7 bits
 			 Parity 1 bit, Even

There are four headers for the type of data and weighing condition.
 Stable weighing data	ST 				Unstable weighing data	US
 Stable counting data	QT 				Out of range ( Over)	OL

Potential ways of retrieving data from weightscale

1. Read the data through the PLC and input the data in the registers controlled by the robot.
	At the end iof a cycle (after the robot insert the Kana in the box), it retrieves the 
	data from a certain register allocated to it and substracts from the weight it was before the input.
	The weight of all elements will need to be logged into a vector and we can access through it using M100.
	In case the difference between the new weight and the previous weight doesn't go beyond the threshold,
	we will trigger the robot to redo the same cycle it just did.
