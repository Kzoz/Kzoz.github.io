Xs and Ys that don't require physical plugs are higher numbers. They are mainly controlled and/or monitored on the RBT program.

x7 = kanamono E2 sensor
x10 = Hopper LS UP
x11 = Hopper LS DOWN
x12 = Hex Nut Presence Sensor Upper Side
x13 = Hex Nut Presence Sensor Lower Side

x20 = Box Lifter (CYL5)Sensor UP
x21 = Box Lifter Sensor DOWN
x22 = Rail Sensor IN (the part bringing boxes to the lifter)
x23 = Rail Sensor OUT

________________________________________________
Y0 (CYL 1) = Hex Nut Cylinder
Y1 (CYL 2) = Robot Hand
Y2 = Broken Port/ Not used
Y3 (CYL 3) = Hex Nut Hopper
Y4 (CYL 5) = Lift Boxes
Y5 (CYL 4) = Pull Boxes to the Lifter
Y6 (CYL 6) = Latches
Y12 (CYL 7) = Belt Conveyer


Y21 = Hex Nut Work done (activated on PLC, reset through RBT)
Y23 = Black pipe Signal(monitored by RBT)
Y24 = Pin Signal (monitored by RBT)
Y26 = Bolt Signal
Y27 = Kanamono E2 Signal
Y30 = Conveyer Flaf for Robot
Y36 = Time Out Error (activated when no more Hex, reset X2 is ON)




Memo:

On robot side, after one work is done, (move to Phome2) and turn ON X104
On robot side, wait Y30 is ON. If Y30 is ON, turn off X104
everything that needs to be changed:
	POS of PPUT
	POS of PTPUT
	POS of P1 to P4
	def Phome2
	POS of PTRANSIT (depending on how it affects the move)
distance from bottom of box to robot hand is 126mm for the P1 to P4 positions
distance from bottom of box to PPUT is 147mm
